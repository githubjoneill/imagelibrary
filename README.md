# Image Library
This Microsoft MAUI app runs on Windows PCs and is intended to help users quickly find and preview SVG (and other) image files that reside on their PC.

The problem case is a user with hundreds of SVG image files scattered across their PC and no simple way to view them unopened. The goal is easy preview of groups of files whether SVG or more readily viewable formats like .jpg and .png plus the ability to search and tag. Ideal users would include creators and crafters who frequently use or design graphics or cut files.  

Once installed, users run the application to select existing image files from any desktop or OneDrive folder on their PC to create the library.
Text searches of the library will return any matches to file names, custom tags, or image notes set by the user.


## Features
- Custom tags can be applied to individual images or from a 'group select' batch.  Tags are included in any image search criteria.
- SVG files will render as images in the search results preview window.
- Optional notes associated with individual images are included in search results. 

## Using this application
 - Install from the Microsoft app store [PC Images Library](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NPG62FW6L8Q)
 - Start adding references to your existing images into the library and then tagging those images to help find them in your searches.
