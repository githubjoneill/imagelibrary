# Image Library
This Microsoft MAUI app runs on Windows PCs and is intended to help users quickly find and preview image files that reside on their PC.

The problem it was designed to address is scenario where a user has hundreds of image files scattered across their PC, and want to quickly preview those images in a single place, using a search term that can include custom tags that the user has assigned to those images.

Once installed, users run the application to select existing image files from any folder on their PC, or any of their OneDrive folders to add to the library.
Image searches applied in the library will return any matches on file names, custom tags, or image notes set by the user.



## Features
- Custom tags can be applied to individual images, or from a 'group select' batch.  Tags are included in any immage search criterial.
- SVG files will render as images in the search results preview window.
- A note can optionaly be applied to any image and that note will be used when searching for images.

## Using this application
 - Install from the Microsof Store - Store name: 'My image library'
 - Start adding references to your existing images into the library and tagging those images.
